# SQL-Database

## Description
This project was designed to advance my knowledge and understanding by creating a backend database with express.js and use sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I learned about models in which they create the table and columns. The seeds file provides testing data, while the routes file contains the APIs to the various tables, then the server.js file syncs up to sequelize the models. CRUD was a major part of this project in how to modify the backend and using insomnia to make API calls.
